# ADR-0001: Distributed Architecture with Ray Framework

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The agent swarm evaluation arena needs to scale to 1000+ concurrent agents with real-time performance requirements. Traditional single-process architectures cannot handle this scale due to Python's GIL limitations and memory constraints. We need a distributed computing framework that can:

1. Scale horizontally across multiple nodes
2. Handle heterogeneous workloads (CPU/GPU)
3. Provide fault tolerance and recovery
4. Support complex synchronization patterns
5. Integrate well with ML/AI ecosystems

## Decision

We will use Ray as the primary distributed computing framework for the arena system because:

- **Native Python Integration**: Seamless integration with existing ML libraries
- **Actor Model**: Natural fit for agent-based simulations
- **Flexible Scheduling**: Support for both CPU and GPU workloads
- **Fault Tolerance**: Automatic recovery from worker failures  
- **Ecosystem Compatibility**: Works well with RLlib, Tune, and other ML tools

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

- **Scalability**: Can scale to thousands of agents across multiple machines
- **Performance**: Parallel execution with minimal overhead
- **Flexibility**: Easy to adjust resource allocation based on workload
- **Ecosystem**: Access to Ray's extensive ML/AI toolkit
- **Development Speed**: Familiar Python programming model

### Negative Consequences

- **Complexity**: Adds distributed systems complexity to debugging
- **Dependencies**: Additional infrastructure requirements (Redis, Ray cluster)
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to understand Ray's programming model
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Tight coupling to Ray ecosystem

### Risks

- **Single Point of Failure**: Ray head node failure affects entire system
- **Memory Usage**: Ray's object store can consume significant memory
- **Networking**: Requires stable, high-bandwidth network connections
- **Version Compatibility**: Ray version upgrades may break existing code

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Multiprocessing + MPI
- **Pros**: Lower-level control, no external dependencies
- **Cons**: Complex to implement, poor fault tolerance, limited scalability

### 2. Dask
- **Pros**: Pandas/NumPy integration, mature ecosystem  
- **Cons**: Less suited for actor-based simulations, weaker GPU support

### 3. Celery + Redis
- **Pros**: Simple task queue model, battle-tested
- **Cons**: Not designed for real-time simulations, poor performance for our use case

### 4. Custom TCP/UDP Solution
- **Pros**: Maximum performance, full control
- **Cons**: Extremely complex to implement correctly, poor time-to-market

## Implementation

### Timeline
- **Phase 1** (Week 1-2): Basic Ray cluster setup and simple agent distribution
- **Phase 2** (Week 3-4): Advanced features (GPU scheduling, fault tolerance)
- **Phase 3** (Week 5-6): Performance optimization and monitoring integration

### Resources Required
- 2 senior engineers for initial implementation
- DevOps support for cluster management
- Hardware: minimum 4-node cluster for testing

### Dependencies
- Ray 2.8+ installation across all nodes
- Redis cluster for Ray's global control store
- High-speed networking (>1Gbps recommended)

### Success Criteria
- Successfully run 1000+ agents across multiple nodes
- Achieve <10ms step latency at target scale
- Demonstrate fault tolerance (recover from single node failure)
- Memory usage scales linearly with agent count
