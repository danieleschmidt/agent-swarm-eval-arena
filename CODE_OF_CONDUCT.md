# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Research Ethics

As a platform focused on multi-agent AI research, we maintain additional ethical standards:

### Responsible AI Development
* **Transparency**: Clearly document all algorithms, methodologies, and limitations
* **Fairness**: Actively work to identify and mitigate biases in agent behaviors and evaluation metrics
* **Safety**: Consider potential misuse scenarios and implement appropriate safeguards
* **Reproducibility**: Ensure all research can be independently verified and replicated

### Data and Privacy
* **Data Protection**: Respect privacy in all data collection and sharing
* **Informed Consent**: Obtain proper consent when using human-generated data
* **Anonymization**: Properly anonymize datasets before public release
* **Retention**: Follow data retention best practices and delete data when appropriate

### Publication and Attribution
* **Proper Citation**: Give credit to all contributors and prior work
* **Open Science**: Encourage open publication and sharing of results
* **Peer Review**: Submit significant findings to peer-reviewed venues
* **Collaboration**: Foster collaborative rather than competitive research environments

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

This includes:
* GitHub repositories and issues
* Discord/Slack channels
* Conference presentations and workshops
* Academic papers and publications
* Social media accounts associated with the project
* Any other forums created by the project team

## Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, 
please notify the community leaders as soon as possible by contacting:

### Response Process

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident. Community leaders will:

1. **Acknowledge** receipt of the report within 24 hours
2. **Investigate** the matter thoroughly and fairly
3. **Decide** on appropriate consequences based on our enforcement guidelines
4. **Communicate** the outcome to relevant parties
5. **Follow up** to ensure the situation is resolved

Reports will be handled with discretion and confidentiality to protect all parties involved.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of
actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent
ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

* Avoid assumptions about technical knowledge levels

When providing feedback on code, ideas, or research:

* Focus on the content, not the person

### Research Discussions

When discussing research ideas and results:
