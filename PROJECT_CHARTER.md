# Project Charter: Agent Swarm Evaluation Arena

## Project Overview

### Mission Statement
Develop the world's most scalable and comprehensive platform for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) evaluation, enabling researchers to conduct experiments with 1000+ concurrent agents while maintaining scientific rigor, reproducibility, and real-time performance.

### Vision
Democratize large-scale multi-agent research by providing an accessible, high-performance platform that accelerates breakthrough discoveries in collective intelligence, emergent behaviors, and cooperative AI systems.

## Problem Statement
