- Performance metrics tracking (FPS, latency, throughput)
- Basic fairness metrics (resource distribution, agent welfare)
- Health monitoring for distributed components

**Distributed Execution**
- Ray cluster integration for horizontal scaling
- Worker node management and fault tolerance
- GPU scheduling and resource allocation
- Inter-node state synchronization

**Visualization**
- Basic 3D arena visualization using matplotlib

## Semantic Versioning Guidelines

This project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **MAJOR version** (X.0.0): Incompatible API changes
- **MINOR version** (0.X.0): New functionality in backwards compatible manner  
- **PATCH version** (0.0.X): Backwards compatible bug fixes

### Pre-release Versions
- **Alpha** (0.X.0-alpha.N): Early development, unstable API
- **Beta** (0.X.0-beta.N): Feature complete, testing phase
- **Release Candidate** (0.X.0-rc.N): Near-final, last testing phase

## Change Categories

### Added
New features and capabilities added to the system.

### Changed  
Changes in existing functionality that maintain backwards compatibility.

### Deprecated
Features that are still available but will be removed in future versions.

### Removed
Features that have been completely removed from the system.

### Fixed
Bug fixes and corrections to existing functionality.

### Security
Security-related improvements, vulnerability fixes, and security feature additions.

## Migration Guides

### Upgrading from 0.0.x to 0.1.0

**Breaking Changes:**
- Agent interface has been completely redesigned
- Environment configuration format changed
- Monitoring API endpoints updated

**Migration Steps:**
1. Update agent implementations to use new `Agent` base class
2. Convert configuration files to new YAML format
3. Update monitoring client code for new WebSocket API
4. Test distributed execution with new Ray integration

**Code Changes Required:**
```python
# Before (0.0.x)
class OldAgent:
    def step(self, state):
        return action

# After (0.1.0)
class NewAgent(Agent):
    def act(self, observation):
        return action
```
